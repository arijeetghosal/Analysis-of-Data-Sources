About The TaskThe data from the analyzed branch databases shall be loaded into the data warehouse. Here you will not just use simple data integration and normalization, but also duplicate detection. Below is an overview of the things to do in this task: 1. Read customers, normalize their attributes and clean them. 2. Detect duplicate customer tuples, i. e. when a customer is registered in multiple branches and would thus be multiple times in your database, if you simply copied the data. 3. Read products, normalize and clean their attributes. 4. Calculate the turnover (sales volume) 5. Calculate the amount of sales in liters for the turnover calculation 6. Determine the age groups of customers Once found mappings of customers to branches should be saved separately. This way the mapping stays consistent and can be used to simplify repeated loading and/or duplicate detection procedures. Further advice: ¥Assume that there was never an address change of a customer, i. e. the same customer always has the same address, no matter the branch or time. ¥ Every customer is only once registered per branch, i. e. inside a brnach you do not have to find duplicate
